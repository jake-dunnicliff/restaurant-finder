The purpose of this app is to give an answer to the question, "Where should we eat?". With our app you can add who is going to your session and pick either a proximity search based off your current location or enter the city and state or zip code manually. From there we generate restaurants closest to you for you to swipe through. Swipe left for not interested, swipe right for interested. We then present you with the highest liked restaurant between your group.
